    <h1>Great Mission Church</h1>
    <p>"Praise the Lord, all you nations; <br>
        extol him, all you peoples.<br>
    2 For great is his love toward us,<br>
        and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.<br>
    Praise the Lord." - Psalms 117</p>

    <h2>Our Worship</h2>
    <p>At Great Mission Church, our worship is grounded on the truth of the Bible as transmitted in the beauty of the Anglican tradition.  It is done with reverence and dignity, according to the time-tested Biblical and traditional forms of the historic Book of Common Prayer (in the edition of 1928).  The full service is printed each week in a Service Bulletin, providing our visitors with a simple guide to follow the service.</p>
