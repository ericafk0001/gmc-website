        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p id="mission">We are a growing parish in the Anglican tradition. <br>
            Our Mission is to fulfill Jesus’ Great Commission - “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,<br> baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching <br>
            them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19-20).<br>
            To do this, we seek to provide those in our parish & community with: <br>
            A Place to Belong, A Faith to Believe In, and A Rule to Live By.</p>

    <h2>Our Worship</h2>
    <p>At Great Mission Church, our worship is grounded on the truth of the Bible as transmitted in the beauty of the Anglican tradition.  It is done with reverence and dignity, according to the time-tested Biblical and traditional forms of the historic Book of Common Prayer (in the edition of 1928).  The full service is printed each week in a Service Bulletin, providing our visitors with a simple guide to follow the service.</p>
